# Divisors-are-two-primes
Find integers from the range [n,k] for which the number of divisors is equal to the product of two prime numbers.
(For example, the number 20 has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. In turn, 6 = 2*3, i. e. the product of two prime numbers.)

Input :
Two integers n and k (1 <= n <= k <= 2×10^5).

Output :
Output the numbers found in ascending order. If there are no such integers in the given range, output 0.
